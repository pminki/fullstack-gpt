      "\n",
      "We'll begin with a light and refreshing **Caprese Salad** elevated with heirloom tomatoes – their diverse colors and sweetness will add a beautiful touch.  For the cheese, we'll use a creamy burrata for a luxurious texture.  A drizzle of high-quality olive oil and fresh basil completes this classic.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the pasta course, I propose a vibrant **Pesto Pasta**.  We'll make a fresh pesto from scratch using basil, pine nuts (or walnuts for a more budget-friendly option), Parmesan cheese (or a delicious vegan alternative like nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor), garlic, and olive oil.  The pesto will be tossed with perfectly cooked linguine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our main course will be a hearty and satisfying **Vegetarian Lasagna**.  Instead of meat, we'll layer tender lentils simmered with herbs and vegetables like zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers.  A rich tomato sauce and layers of creamy ricotta cheese (or vegan ricotta) and mozzarella will complete this comforting dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a side, we'll have simple yet elegant **Roasted Asparagus** with a sprinkle of sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper.  The roasting will bring out the asparagus's natural sweetness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, for a touch of indulgence, we'll finish with some crusty **Garlic Bread**.  We'll use a good quality baguette, brushed with garlic butter (or vegan butter) and herbs, then toasted to golden perfection.\n",
