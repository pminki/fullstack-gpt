It typically includes seasoned rice, saut√©ed vegetables (like spinach, carrots, zucchini), a fried egg, bulgogi (marinated beef), and gochujang.\\n\\n* **Bulgogi:**  Thinly sliced marinated beef is grilled or pan-fried.  The marinade usually includes soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, sugar, and pear or onion for sweetness.\\n\\n* **Kimchi jjigae (Kimchi Stew):**  A hearty stew made with kimchi, pork (or tofu), onions, and other vegetables.
